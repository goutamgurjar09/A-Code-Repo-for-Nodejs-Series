//RestFul Architecture

*its a way of writing a code

//RESTFUL -> means WAY/TARIKA
* RE -> Representational
* S -> State
* T -> Transfer

//OVERALL Means 1 tarika adapt kar lete hai and us tarike se saare code likhte hai

//ex-> DRY : DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF
//     WET : WRITE EVERYTHING TWICE



//-------------------
//Restful-Api => to provide data means jb bi hm server se req. krte hai tb hme ek data milta hai responce ke roop me
                 //restful means way of writing/ hm jo bhi req. bhejte hai bo restful tarike se usi ko khte hai and hme data milta hai

//ex- app.get('/cat',(req,res){}) this is way of writing/restful way

//-------------------
//Restful-Routes => jb bhi hm req. krte hai tb hme ya to data milega ya page ->ydi hme data milta hai to hm use REST-API khte hai and 
//                  jb bhi hme koi page milega to use hm Restful-Routes khte hai
