Templating -> Templating is derived from template->  means like structure 
//Ex:- jaise reddit.com website pr hm kuch bhi like->https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/  , https://www.reddit.com/r/cat/   bcz /r fixed path hai -> ke baad jo bhi likhte hai to hme usse releted page milta hai
//like-> apple,cat,dog.... path pr  req. bheji hmne server ko or server hme responce ke roop me pura page de rha 
//but jo bhi hm serch krte hai uska data /template change hota hai 
//overall means ek template define kr diya hai hmne and usme kbi dog/cat/apple ...and so on ese data change hor ha hai

//---------------------
//1. how to make a template?

//temalte are create using templating engines //like-> hbs , ejs ,jade ,nunjucks ,pug  etc and...so on

//but we are going to use ejs which is very similer to JS
//and isko use krne ke liye hme ise install krna pdega then require it  -> npm i ejs  
//Go official website- ejs.co

//---------------------
//how to use it?

const path = require('path')  //for path.join

app.set('view engine' , 'ejs') 
app.set('views' , path.join(__dirname , 'views'))

//Note: here-> ejs is templating engine name and usko app.set('view engine', 'ejs')  iski help se set krte hai
//'view engine' ->property
//'ejs' ->value

//Note: here-> app.set('views' , path.join(__dirname , 'views'))
//first 'views' -> property  and 
//path.join(__dirname , 'views')-> views folder ko path.join ki help se join kr rhe
//__dirname-> bcz hm kise bhi directory/path pr ho skte hai isliye hm ise path.join() ki help se __dirname ka use krke join kr rhe rather  then ->process.cwd() + '/views'
//isliye hmne path ko starting me require kr liya


//-----------------
like->directory/folder same
In a Node.js application, the line app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views')) is used to configure the views directory for the Express.js framework.

Let's break it down:

app: This is an instance of the Express application. It is created when you call express() to create your app.

.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views')): This line is using the set method of the Express application to configure a setting. In this case, it's configuring the 'views' setting.

'views': This is the setting being configured. In Express, the 'views' setting is used to specify the directory where your views (templates) are stored.

path.join(__dirname, 'views'): This part uses the path.join method to create an absolute path to the 'views' directory/folder. __dirname is a global variable in Node.js that represents the directory name of the current module (i.e., the directory where the current script resides).
So, overall, this line is telling Express to look for views (templates) in the 'views' directory of your application,
and the 'views' directory is assumed to be located in the same directory as the script (__dirname).
